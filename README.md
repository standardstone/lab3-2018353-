### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---

I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning ilbraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
or [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and other open source softwares.
